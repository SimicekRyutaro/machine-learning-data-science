# machine-learning-data-science
Collection of machine learning, data science and statistical modeling projects

## Python

1. **Binary classification**: My first contact with machine learning, binary classification using decision tree and KNN
2. **Regression**: Custom implementation of the random forest, regression using the random forest, linear regression, KNN and decision tree
3. **Dimensionality reduction and binary classification**: Image binary classification using SVM, Naive Bayes and LDA, generating images, dimensionality reduction using PCA and LLE, comparing the results of binary classification with different numbers of dimensions
4. **Neural networks**: Image classification using neural networks (feedforward and convolutional), experimenting with different numbers of layers and neurons, regularization methods and optimizers
5. **Exploratory data analysis**: Analyzing and visualizing data from animal shelter, trying to find relationships between features
6. **Public transport network analysis**: Analyzing and visualizing the tram network in Prague, exploring the important stops and answering questions
7. **Machine learning visualization**: Using decision tree to predict obesity, analyzing and visualizing the dataset as well as the classification results

## R

1. **Employment in Austria**: Statistical analysis of employment data in different sectors in Austria in 2022, contingency table, statistical tests
2. **Nitrate concentration in rivers**: Regression using both continuous and categorical features, trying to find the best model (good, but simple)
