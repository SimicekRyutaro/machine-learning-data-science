## Python

1. **Binary classification**: My first contact with machine learning, binary classification using decision tree and KNN
2. **Regression**: Custom implementation of the random forest, regression using the random forest, linear regression, KNN and decision tree
3. **Dimensionality reduction and binary classification**: Image binary classification using SVM, Naive Bayes and LDA, generating images, dimensionality reduction using PCA and LLE, comparing the results of binary classification with different numbers of dimensions
