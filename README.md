# machine-learning-data-science
Collection of machine learning, data science and statistical modeling projects

## Python

1. **Binary classification** (CZ): My first contact with machine learning, binary classification using decision tree and KNN
2. **Regression** (CZ): Custom implementation of the random forest, regression using the random forest, linear regression, KNN and decision tree
3. **Dimensionality reduction and binary classification** (CZ): Image binary classification using SVM, Naive Bayes and LDA, generating images, dimensionality reduction using PCA and LLE, comparing the results of binary classification with different numbers of dimensions
4. **Neural networks** (CZ): Image classification using neural networks (feedforward and convolutional), experimenting with different numbers of layers and neurons, regularization methods and optimizers
5. **Exploratory data analysis** (CZ): Analyzing and visualizing data from animal shelter, trying to find relationships between features
6. **Public transport network analysis** (CZ): Analyzing and visualizing the tram network in Prague, exploring the important stops and answering questions
7. **Machine learning visualization** (CZ): Using decision tree to predict obesity, analyzing and visualizing the dataset as well as the classification results
8. **Valorant web scraping** (EN): Web scraping stats from professional Valorant matches, using logistic regression to predict the winnning team

## R

1. **Employment in Austria** (CZ): Statistical analysis of employment data in different sectors in Austria in 2022, contingency table, statistical tests
2. **Nitrate concentration in rivers** (CZ): Regression using both continuous and categorical features, trying to find the best model (good, but simple) 
3. **Wage in Europe** (CZ): Regression predicting wages in European countries, trying to find the best model, discussing outliers, testing model assumptions
